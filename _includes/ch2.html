My name is Dr. Terise Cruven, and I'm writing down my story because I've recently uncovered some urgent issues that I feel I need to warn you about.

Last year, I started analyzing the transaction data of a company called Kagaku K≈çkoku.  That's one of those companies where you might not have heard of them, but they've heard of you.  They were one of the first to track people's behavior and use that information to shape human decision making.  The company (literally translated as Scientific Advertisement) started more than thirty years ago working on optimizing print advertising, but soon transitioned to forms of online content: journalism, entertainment, pornography. It was one of the only firms to try to own the whole process: conceptualization, testing, delivery, tracking.

The fact that they were doing this wasn't anything unexpected though.  Many researchers had been detecting their influences on human behavior for decades at this point. What actually surprised me was when my research uncovered that Kagaku, ostensibly just an advertising firm, was suddenly diverting a quarter of its multi-billion dollar budget to a handful of tiny, unregulated, Chinese and Russian biotechnology companies.

The problem with devoting my life's work to trawling the repository of all recorded information is that I occasionally put together connections I wish I hadn't noticed.
