The operating webcam turned back on twelve minutes after the last dissection was already finished.  The poor octopus body was still bobbing at the top of the aquarium.  Ezzy was too focused on the surgery to even bother putting the poor thing to sleep after it had given up its arms to her.
</p>
<p>
She was sewing the arms into an array of microchips while the poor thing watched her.  If only the little invalid could have understood what she was doing, what she was putting in motion.  It would maybe have felt a little justified vindication I assume.  Knowing that its suffering was just another step towards the end of the world.

The octopus was just a stepping stone in Ezzy's mind too.  The only animal that could be used for her experiment.  He was a means to an end<span class="v1">.</span><a class="v2" href="#" onclick="return toggle_element('ch10_1');">.</a>

		David had been that too.  Ezzy hadn't seen him in more than a week now.  Did she miss him?  Her glorified domestic animal.  Honestly, he wasn't even that glorified.

	<p>
		Last sighted, he was vomiting in front of his hotel in the city. She'd come to visit him and tell him everything was alright.  The moment he saw her approaching. he turned to run madly down the street in the direction of the university.

	<p>
		I don't even mind about that nonsense," she'd told him, "nobody cares about who you sleep with, and it won't even affect my career..." her voice drifted a little "...that much."  He didn't care to be pandered to.  She thought he'd run his wildness out and come back homme for the night.

	<p>
		But he hadn't responded for one, then two, then three days. Ezzy couldn't wait in the city any longer.  She had to get back to her octopuses.

The octopus is a singular creation of all the creatures great and small.  It is, by most commonly accepted scientific estimates, the only living being that has its consciousness broadly distributed across multiple subsections of its body.
</p>
<p>
Similar to Gwendolyn—two halves of her mind fused with a single cord—the octopus appears to be an embodiment of 8 separate minds housed, physically, at the base of each of its arms.  Each is connected through a similar narrow band of nerves, through which they communicate like separate consciousnesses speaking in an almost instantaneous language.
</p>
<p>
The arms grow up together into more of a tightly coupled community as opposed to a single conscious identity.  They continue to operate mostly independently having their own thoughts and desires, apparently communicating directly to each other arm.  The body only enters the picture to deal with some of the shared activities like eating and spraying ink.
</p>
<p>
Ezzy was exploiting the melding of the separate minds in the octopus arms to carry out her experiments. The arms wriggled in their harnesses carrying out their tasks, asking confused questions to each other.  Ezzy set her alarm and popped a downer to put herself instantly into a deep recuperative sleep.
</p>
<p>
She woke three hours later, tossed the dead arms into the biohazard bin, checked the integrity of the data, stripped her clothes and stepped into the bath she'd prepped the night before.  The water was cold.  Ezzy's nerves were numb to it anyway by now.
