<h4 id='ch1'>Octopus and Adderall</h4>

<p class="v3">"Out early for drugs and octopus," Ezzy texted.</p>

<p>
<span class="notv3">Ezzy's phone let out a short, quiet tick as her assistant's next text came in.</span> <span class="v3">She was sitting on the hallway floor of the Institute's distribution center, head leaning back against the wall</span>. Three seconds after 6 AM she started tapping impatiently on the glass<span class="notv3"> of the Institute's distribution center</span><span class="v3"> between her and the narcotics cabinet</span>. She handed the <span class="notv3">narcotics</span> requisition to the half-awake clerk, and he pushed the bottles across the counter with a detached shrug<span class="notv2">.</span><a class="v2" href="#" onclick="return toggle_element('ch1_1');">.</a>  <span class="xpand" id="ch1_1">She carefully checked the label on each bottle.</span> She dropped the bottles into her backpack and slipped down the stairwell to the supply tunnel that ran under campus to the marine center. <span class="v6">She thought, and felt the coldness of the tunnel walls around her.</span>   <span class="notv3">The specimen haul came in after 9.  The EPA allotted only 10 harp-toothed octopuses to be harvested off the coast of Maine each week. Today they'd found two, and Ezzy claimed them both.</span><span class="v3">She waited on the dock until 9 when the divemaster finally brought her two harp-toothed octopuses.</span>
</p>
<p>
"<span class="v3">I can't believe they only let me have two!</span><span class="notv3">It'd be easier getting clearance to work with the plague</span>," she texted to her assistant, Cass, driving home with one hand on the steering wheel, "at least they didn't notice I took more amphetamine than my D.E.A clearance allowed."
</p>
<p>When she pulled back up to the house, Cass was waiting with a cup of coffee<span class="notv3"> and a bottle of the nutritional slush she pretended was breakfast</span>.  He grabbed the bag of narcotics out of the passenger seat.
</p>
<p>
<span class="notv3">What a list!" he said, looking at the requisition receipt, </span>"100 grams cocaine, 400 milliliters methamphetamine, and 60 tablets of adderall.  You're going to have a damn good time here without me, huh?
</p>
<p>
"I'm going to try working on these two all day," she said, <span class="notv3">waving the octopuses at him and hurrying to the door to the garage-turned-laboratory she'd built over the summer</span><span class="v3">carrying the octopuses into the garage that she'd turned into her laboratory over the summer</span>.  "It'd really help me a lot if you could check back for more specimens from the evening haul before you leave."  She stepped into the garage and started preparing her equipment.
</p>
<p>
"Um," Cass wrinkled up his face, "actually, I have to head back into the city for a meeting with the funder."
</p>
<p>
"Oh," Ezzy said, "well, just drop that stuff off over there, and I'll see you Monday. Tell Senke we're close. I can feel it."
</p>
<p>
In her lab, Ezzy poured the octopuses from their container into the aquarium.  They stretched their legs out wide and puffed little swirling vortices of ink into the water around them.  She leaned her forehead up against the glass of the aquarium and dipped her finger in the cold salt water.
</p>
<p>
"There's nothing else in the world quite like you," she whispered.
