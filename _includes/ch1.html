Ezzy's phone alarm chimed. She paused for a breath, then started tapping impatiently on the glass window of the Institute's distribution center. When she handed the narcotics requisition to the half-awake clerk, he pushed the bottles across the counter with a detached shrug<a href="#" onclick="return toggle_element('ch1_1');">.</a>  <span class="xpand" id="ch1_1">She carefully checked the label on each bottle. This clerk's carelessness had cost her a day of work before.</span> She dropped the bottles into her backpack and rushed down the stairwell to the supply tunnels.  This was the quickest way across campus to the marine center.  She'd spend the rest of the morning waiting for the specimen haul to come in.  The EPA allotted only 25 harp-toothed octopuses to be harvested for research per week. Today they'd only found two, but she claimed them both.
</p>
<p>
"easier to get clearance to work with bubonic plague," she texted to her partner, David, with one hand on the steering wheel, "and if you thought the dea was tough, dont even think about getting more specimens out of the epa."
</p>
<p>
"At least <a href="#" onclick="return toggle_element('ch1_2');">T</a>erise's letter opened some doors," she wrote to David. <span class="xpand" id="ch1_2">Esmeralda and I had never met in person, but when I learned about her <a href="#" onclick="return toggle_element('ch1_3');">r</a>esearch, I'd used what little sway I had to get her experiments approved.</span>  <span class="xpand" id="ch1_3">I'd been helping her out ever since I discovered her early work into human attention. She'd coined the term <i>focus-addiction</i> early in her career to describe an overabundance of the brain's craving for the stimulation that can only come from engaging in a seemingly productive, active task.  It had meant almost nothing to her at the time, but the concept had played well with the readers of the Times' Sunday Science section. By now, she'd written focus-addiction into hundreds of grant applications, winnowing its meaning from a grand, universal concept down to abstruse, formalized academic jargon.  </span>

<p>
"The doors of perception, right?" David replied, with a winky face ";)"
</p>
<p>
She rolled her eyes.  Listening to his jokes had become one of her least favorite chores over their decade living and working together.  </p>


<p>When she pulled back up to the house, he was waiting with a cup of coffee and a bottle of the nutritional slush she pretended was breakfast.  He grabbed the bag of narcotics out of the passenger seat.
</p>
<p>
"What a list!" he smirked, looking at the requisition receipt, "100 grams cocaine, 400 milliliters methamphetamine, and 60 tablets of adderall. You're going to have a damn good time here without me, huh?
</p>
<p>
"I'm going to try working on these two all day," she said, waving the octopuses at him and hurrying to the door to the garageâ€”or rather, the garage that she'd converted into a laboratory so she could skirt protocol and get ahead of her work.  "It'd really help me a lot if you could check back for more specimens from the evening haul before you leave."  She stepped into the garage and started preparing her equipment.
</p>
<p>
"Eh," David wrinkled up his face, "I was going to get a head start back into the city."
</p>
<p>
"No problem," Ezzy said, "just drop that stuff off over there, and I'll see you Monday."  She feigned positivity. She didn't really have the time for the argument that would follow if she let him know she was annoyed<a href="#" onclick="return toggle_element('ch1_4');">.</a>

		"Christ, David," Izzy yelled off the back balcony, "get your ass back inside." 
	</p>
	<p>
		David spun on his heel to face her, nude, a Northesastern thunderstorm pouring down around him.  This feeling of living, of failing.  He'd missed this sensation.
	</p>
	<p>
		Ezzy slid the glass door closed.  She returned to her laptop on the couch.  The grant application was on its 11th draft.  She held down a combination of keys and pulled up every mention of the phrase "focus addiction." 424 occurences.
	</p>
	<p>
		David had timidly re-entered through the garage.  He shivered himself to dry himself a little.  He shivered again.  He hadn't seen the back of the garage for a few months now since Ezzy had barred him from coming back inside and disturbing her operations.  In the center there was now a makeshift lab bench, covered in electronic equipment.  The four legs of the massive plywood bench were each comprised of stacks of outdated textbooks.  If David hadn't been quite so drunk, he'd have seen that his copy of their high school yearbook was on the top of the stack next to him.
	</p>
	<p>
		Ezzy was scattered across dozens of pages.  David occupied just one.  That book was 21 years old now.
	</p>
	<p style="text-align: center; text-indent:0">*</p>

<p>
In her lab, Ezzy dumped the octopuses from their container into the massive aquarium in the corner of the room.  They stretched their legs out wide and puffed little swirling vortices of ink into the water around them.  Ezzy leaned her forehead up against the glass of the aquarium and dipped her finger in the warm salt water.

<p> 
"There's nothing else in the world quite like you," she whispered.
</p>
<p>
As I write this, I wonder what she would have done if she could have known where her experiments would eventually lead. If she'd have known that her work would bring about a little girl's psychosis, David's suicide, a revoked Nobel prize, and what some <em>might</em> call the end of the world as we know it.  I can't prove it, but I suspect she would not have done a single thing differently.
