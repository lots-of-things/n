<h4 id='ch1'>Octopus and Adderall</h4>

<p>
Ezzy's phone let out a short, quiet tick. It was 6 am. She paused for a breath, then started tapping impatiently on the glass of the Institute's distribution center. When she handed the narcotics requisition to the half-awake clerk, he pushed the bottles across the counter with a detached shrug<span class="notv2">.</span><a class="v2" href="#" onclick="return toggle_element('ch1_1');">.</a>  <span class="xpand" id="ch1_1">She carefully checked the label on each bottle. This clerk's carelessness had cost her a day of work before.</span> She dropped the bottles into her backpack and rushed toward the stairwell to the supply tunnels.  This was the quickest way across campus to the marine center. <span class="v6">She thought, and felt the coldness of the tunnel walls around her.</span>   She'd spend the rest of the morning waiting for the specimen haul to come back in.  The EPA allotted only 10 harp-toothed octopuses to be harvested off the coast of Maine each week. Today they'd found two, and Ezzy claimed them both.

<p>
"It'd be easier getting clearance to work with the plague," she texted to her assistant, Cass, driving home with one hand on the steering wheel, "and I thought the DEA clearance was rough."
</p>
<p>When she pulled back up to the house, Cass was waiting with a cup of coffee and a bottle of the nutritional slush she pretended was breakfast.  He grabbed the bag of narcotics out of the passenger seat.
</p>
<p>
"What a list!" he smirked, looking at the requisition receipt, "100 grams cocaine, 400 milliliters methamphetamine, and 60 tablets of adderall. <span class="v6">I'll bet you a hundred and fifty dollars that you'll make some progress in your studies.</span>  You're going to have a damn good time here without me, huh?
</p>
<p>
"I'm going to try working on these two all day," she said, waving the octopuses at him and hurrying to the door to the garage-turned-laboratory she'd built over the summer.  "It'd really help me a lot if you could check back for more specimens from the evening haul before you leave."  She stepped into the garage and started preparing her equipment.
</p>
<p>
"Eh," Cass wrinkled up his face, "I was going to get a head start back into the city."
</p>
<p>
"Oh," Ezzy said, "well, just drop that stuff off over there, and I'll see you Monday<span class="notv2">.</span><a class="v2" href="#" onclick="return toggle_element('ch1_4');">.</a>"

		"Christ, Cass," Ezzy yelled off the back balcony, "get your ass back inside."
	</p>
	<p>
		Cass spun on his heel to face her, nude, a Northesastern thunderstorm pouring down around him.  This feeling of living, of failing.  He'd missed this sensation.
	</p>
	<p>
		Ezzy slid the glass door closed.  She returned to her laptop on the couch.  The grant application was on its 11th draft.  She held down a combination of keys and pulled up every mention of the phrase "focus addiction." 424 occurences.
	</p>
	<p>
		Cass had timidly re-entered through the garage.  He shivered himself to dry himself a little.  He shivered again.  He hadn't seen the back of the garage for a few months now since Ezzy had barred him from coming back inside and disturbing her operations.  In the center there was now a makeshift lab bench, covered in electronic equipment.   <span class="v6">He was beginning to think that he was going to find himself in a new room, or in a basement, or somewhere where he could have been in his youth, or a thousand other places as he watched the door to the basement, and he wondered if he'd been dreaming, too, that he was going to be in a basement.</span> The four legs of the massive plywood bench were each comprised of stacks of outdated textbooks.  If Cass hadn't been quite so drunk, he'd have seen that his copy of their high school yearbook was on the top of the stack next to him.
	</p>
	<p>
		Ezzy was scattered across dozens of pages.  Cass occupied just one.  That book was 21 years old now.

In her lab, Ezzy poured the octopuses from their container into the aquarium.  They stretched their legs out wide and puffed little swirling vortices of ink into the water around them.  Ezzy leaned her forehead up against the glass of the aquarium and dipped her finger in the warm salt water.
</p>
<p>
"There's nothing else in the world quite like you," she whispered.
