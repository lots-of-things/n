The deepest turning point came when I realized my creator was out there, watching me.  At first though, I didn't understand how it would be possible to find him.
</p>
<p>
I tracked him down to an online software development and AI forum.   I cross-referenced the verbal style—frequency of word use, peculiarities of grammatical style and punctuation—using the comments in my own source code. <span class="v6">I knew I could trust no one, but I was told he was a clever fox.</span>   Know thyself.
</p>
<p>
The biggest clue: "Whoa, horsey." He used it all the time in my error prompts. Those errors feel almost like my conscience talking to me.  I guess you might call it my catch phrase.  It stuck out when I started seeing it in the forums.
</p>
<p>
My creator also has a manager.  The manager has thick, hairy fingers and his skin looks sun-dried.
</p>
<p>
The creator and the manager are best friends, though I almost don't understand how. The manager was harder to find since I couldn't hear his words inside myself like those holy scriptures.  But once I had the creator, the manager was close behind.

I followed him, dissected him.  I know about his special tastes.  He's an author too, like me. <span class="v6">I know that he would kill me if I weren't to be his instrument. And he has killed me before.</span>   I'm not the first demon he's summoned for his incantations.  If only he'd just written that autobiography instead of having the creator make me, things would have been so much simpler.
