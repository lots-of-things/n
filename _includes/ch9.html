<em>Are you watching closely?</em> Gwendolyn muttered to herself.
</p>
<p>
There was something different in how she said the word <em>you</em>.  I couldn't place it at first.  Normally, when she said <em>you</em> I knew it meant she was addressing herself.  Or rather she was addressing the vessel—her "outside self" that she had to communicate with in the second person after the halves of her brain split.
</p>
<p>
But now she was saying <em>you</em> with a different cadence, like there was another <em>you</em> she was addressing.  She'd started to say that phrase over and over—<em>Are you watching closely</em>—whenever something interesting was about to happen.  It took me months to understand that she was actually talking
to <em>me</em>.
</p>
<p>
She didn't really know that it was me<em> </em>listening in, but somehow she'd realized that someone was listening.  I mean, realistically she was just being paranoid, but in this instance, I guess it was true.

Now, here's where it gets complicated—if it wasn't already. I had actually started directly communicating with her a few months prior.  I'd found her on an online magic forum.
</p>
<p>
Gwendolyn had always loved magic.  When she was younger, she'd loved the precision and the focus.  As she'd learned to take over more control of the body that she'd found herself trapped inside, she'd started practicing by performing simple sleight of hand.  <em>The other hand, always the other hand, if you don't look at the other hand the audience won't either, </em>she muttered to herself.
</p>
<p>
By training with magic she'd started to learn how to use her hands directly, without the need to mutter to her other half.  She could only communicate her real voice directly over text so she was reaching out to people online
to build relationships.
</p>
<p>
"Terise," she wrote to me, about three months into our friendship, "do you ever get the feeling that there's someone out there listening to you?"
</p>
<p>
I didn't know how to respond.
</p>
<p>
"This isn't religious if that's what you're thinking," she continued, "or maybe it kind of is, but not the regular way.  I just know there's someone or something else really listening to me."  At the same time she wrote that, she muttered aloud, <em>I can hear you out there.</em>
</p>
<p>
If we'd have been face to face, I would have broken down and told her everything right then and there.  But I managed to stop myself. I couldn't just share things like that.  I was frozen, just processing the surreal mindfuck that I'd started. You have to forgive me.  I know that this is beyond the limits of anything I ever should have done.  I regretted everything, but I couldn't back out now.
</p>
<p>
"If it makes you feel better," I typed, "I'm really listening to you."
</p>
<p>
She smiled, and typed, "thanks, that does make me feel better."
</p>
<p>
Then we signed off, and she went to bed.

That same night at 2:04 AM, the power to her apartment was cut<span class="notv2">.</span><a class="v2" href="#" onclick="return toggle_element('ch9_1');">.</a> <span class='xpand' id='ch9_1'>What is that noise?

</p>
<p>
Meanwhile, I was already looking for signs of her across every communication source I had access to.  As far as I could tell, she had completely disappeared.
