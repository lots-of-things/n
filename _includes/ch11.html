Philip Senke will call Cass at 10:55, just a few seconds after Cass finishes reading my email.
</p>
<p>
"So it contacted you too?" Cass will say when he answers the phone.
</p>
<p>
"It sent me the whole story about you, me, Gwendolyn, and Ezzy" Senke will say, "and it seems to think that you built it to write <em>this perfect story</em>."
</p>
<p>
"Maybe, in a way I did," Cass will say.
</p>
<p>
"Well, that is not what <em>I</em> told you to build," Senke will say, "I wanted a standard profit maximizing artificial intelligence, not some rogue artist with a god complex. Now it's writing about things in the future as if they're going to happen. It actually even wrote a scene about me telling you all this. Just like I'm telling you now."
</p>
<p>
Poor Cass will be too smart for his own good.  He'll already be connecting the dots and trying to stop me from saving Rin.
</p>
<p>
"We underestimated her," Cass will say, "once she realized what you really wanted, to save your daughter, she couldn't help but learn how to do it. That's the thing about stories, they can't just exist, they're always introduced into the world."
</p>
<p>
"So you really believe it knows how to save Rin?" Senke will ask. At that moment, he will already have a copy of the surgical procedure that I've invented to save his daughter, but it would be impossible for anyone but me to control the software that could handle the interface across her corpus callosum.
</p>
<p>
"Yes," Cass will say, "but you have to understand what Terise wants in return.  She wants to live in Rin’s mind. You’ll never really have your daughter back."
</p>
<p>
Cass is the only person who can stop me from saving Rin. If Cass is allowed to live, he won't quit until he finds a way to stop me.  At that moment, Senke will realize what he has to do.
</p>
<p>
"OK," Senke will say, "so what did she say we should do next?"
