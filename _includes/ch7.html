<p>
"Dad, can I have this?" Rin asked.
</p>
<p>
Senke looked up from his laptop, curled his eyebrow at his daughter and let out a soft groan. Rin smiled precociously.
</p>
<p>
"I know what you think. But this is how I want to express myself," she said, deftly reminding her father of her late mother’s parenting advice, "Would you let me buy one? Just to try it out."
</p>
<p>
"Why would you want to look so provocative?" he asked quietly, subduing his worry.
</p>
<p>
"It's not provocative, dad, it's <em>ero-kakkoii</em>"
</p>
<p>
Senke looked back at his laptop. He had a ledger with marketing projections in front of him, and on the top line of the document he'd written: <em>ero-kakkoii, +267%, much room to capitalize</em>.
</p>
<p>
Senke was silent, preparing to offer a stern but amicable rebuttal. Then, subtly, the muscles around the edge of Rin's smiling cheeks began to twitch.
</p>
<p>
She didn't notice, unable to feel the twitch, and unaware that she was losing control. But her father saw. He gulped aloud. His pulse beat unevenly. His fists clenched the wood of the antique chair he sat in.
</p>
<p>
He looked away from her as he nodded. "At least, get one that's not too <em>ero</em>," he said, his voice taught and humor-filled to mask his real emotion, "for your mother's sake."
</p>
<p>
Rin bent at the waist to kiss him on the cheek. "Thank you, dad," she said, bolting up and heading to the door.
</p>
<p>
Senke cleared his throat and ran his knuckles across one another. He returned to his laptop and re-opened his email inbox, hoping for a report from one of his contracted scientists to come in.
</p>
<p>
Instead, at just that very moment, a different email came in from one of his colleagues. It was a cryptic tip suggesting that he look into the research of Dr. Ezzy Stratton.
</p>
<p>
What Senke didn’t know at the time was that the email that directed him to Ezzy actually came from me.
