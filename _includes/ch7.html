"Can you hold a sample from the specimen dive for me?"  Ezzy wrote to the dive manager.  She'd have had Cass go fetch it if he was still alive.
</p>
<p>
He'd killed himself two weeks ago, just after he'd arrived at his hotel in Boston.   <span class="v6">He'd been in the pool, and in the tub, and he'd gone down one side and into the other. She thought, and felt a twinge of guilt.</span> No time to think about him now.  Just get the data pulled up, grab an Adderral, refresh the intravenous into the octopus arms.
</p>
<p>
"So what have you determined?" Senke asked immediately when his face appeared on the screen.    He was perturbed at her requiring him to communicate over video-conference. <span class="v6">"The people of my world are extremely intelligent, but they are also very simple."</span> He preferred the reports to come to him anonymously.  He hated to let anything about himself be projected out into the web for someone like me to scoop up.
</p>
<p>
"Does the data not speak for itself?" she asked.
</p>
<p>
"Please interpret. I'm not a scientist after all."
</p>
<p>
She pulled up the diagram showing the one octupus arm, the injection apparatus, the neural-machine interface.  There was a graph showing dosage vs. number of neural connections.
</p>
<p>
"Here you can see that with the right dosage, we can perfectly simulate the communication between the separated arms through the computer interface.  We've passed the Turing test on the neuron to neuron level."
</p>
<p>
"Turing test?" Senke asked.
</p>
<p>
Ezzy pulled up a chart of each pair of octopus arms in the experiment.
</p>
<p>
"Here you can see that this first set of arms are talking directly to each other through the neurons that I've surgically fused together.  Now, for this second set, the brain housed in each arm is talking to this little electronic chip and that chip is relaying the information back and forth. They don't really know that the chip is there, and that allows us to simulate one arm and play it back to the other.  And amazingly, neither can tell that it's talking to a recording."
</p>
<p>
"And how much do you have to slow down their minds?"
</p>
<p>
Ezzy smiled. She lifted one of the caps from the row of pill bottles next to her, and held it up.
</p>
<p>
"That's just the thing," she said, "the breakthrough came when I stopped trying to slow them down. Completely counter to the intuition of anyone in this entire field."
</p>
<p>
Senke frowned.  "Not what I expected to hear." <span class="v6">The results were still in her hands.</span> He didn't trust her results.  He'd expected the Russian scientists to get the solution first, quicker to skirt the ethical concerns.
</p>
<p>
"Well you can't argue with the Science here, sir."  She was the type to subconsciously use Science as a proper noun.
</p>
<p>
Ezzy dumped the contents of the bottle onto the counter in front of her laptop.
</p>
<p>
"Have you ever tried this?" she asked.
</p>
<p>
"And that is?"
</p>
<p>
"Good old fashioned Adderall of all things.  I used it a ton as a kid.  I never would have guessed.  Has Rin ever used Adderall?"
</p>
<p>
Senke's stern face broke out red with anger, but he kept his voice tight and professional.  "Do not mention my daughter's name in relation to this project ever again."
</p>
<p>
Ezzy squirmed uncomfortably. It was healthier that she never saw Rin, even if it made it more difficult to connect with her in the end.  She wouldn't see Rin as a person, as Senke's daughter.  Rin was just another specimen.  She was cut off from the emotional impact that way.
</p>
<p>
"Alright then," Ezzy said, "what I'm trying to get at is that in order for a neural interface to be connected, such as the one we'll need to save Ri—." She halted short under Senke's glare.
</p>
<p>
"Basically," she started over, standing up and pacing away from her webcam, "last week, I had a night where I was finding it very hard to pay attention to this project.  I was getting tired."
</p>
<p>
"You're personal emotions don't really concern me," Senke said, "I'm paying for your focus."
</p>
<p>
She wouldn't tell Senke that Cass had died.
</p>
<p>
"That's just it," Ezzy said, "I couldn't force myself to focus on anything so I started taking the Adderall. Then all of the sudden it was like I could hear them.  To understand how they were feeling. I could start to focus on them and figure them out, not just use them to get my experiments over with."
</p>
<p>
She certainly wouldn't tell him what had happened.  How and why Cass had died. That would make him nervous. <span class="v6"> Cass had asked himself, and now he was in a state of shock.</span>   She reached the counter behind her desk and pulled a glass and her favorite bottle of vodka off the shelf.
</p>
<p>
"And what I realized, when I could really pay attention, was that the arms were each acting just like me," she said, pouring the vodka and taking a delicate sip, "they don't care what's going on inside each other. They only want to be heard, so they talk but don't really listen, and because of that, the connections were only ever formed one way," she said, "outward."
</p>
<p>
She took a deeper drink.
</p>
<p>
"All they want is for someone to listen to them."
</p>
<p>
She'd had no one to listen to her anymore.
</p>
<p>
"But with the Adderall, you can trick them into actually listening to each other. And that's how you coax them to fuse together.  They start to think like the same mind, like the way we hear our own voice in our heads."
</p>
<p>
"I see," Senke said.
</p>
<p>
Ezzy was taken aback.
</p>
<p>
"You do?" she asked.  It was something she could only barely understand herself. Two minds enrapt with complete attention for one another, merging into one. Improvising and knowing just what note the other half would sing, and knowing that the other half knows what you'll sing too.
</p>
<p>
Senke nodded slowly and looked across his room to a photo.
</p>
<p>
"My wife used to say—" he started, but cut himself off.
</p>
<p>
Ezzy froze up, shuddering at Senke's sudden sincerity.  She had to force herself to keep listening.
</p>
<p>
"She'd tell me how she knew I loved her," he continued, "because she could always hear me think it just before I'd say it."
