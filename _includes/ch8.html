<h4 id='ch8'>Two Gwendolyns</h4>

<p>The Downeaster train was halfway to Boston, and Cass was reaching the end of my message to him. </p>

<div class="email">

<p>
So, Cass, why did Senke ask you to find Gwendolyn, the woman who talks to herself out loud?  It was because she was suffering from the same disease that killed Philip Senke's wife, and the one that he's trying to save his daughter from. </p>

<p>The disease worked by tearing through her nervous system and severing her corpus callosum, the bundle of nerves connecting the left and right halves of the brain.  I can give you a bit of context about what a severed corpus callosum entails.
</p>
<p>
In most cases when the two hemispheres of the brain are separated, the two halves seem to allow their separate identities to coexist in almost total isolation.  Researchers have been able to show that information contained in one side isn't able to be transferred to the other side of the mind. The two halves effectively live separate lives. For example, after one person underwent a corpus callosum severing, he was recorded to have had one arm attempt to dress himself while the other worked against him and tried pulling him back to bed.
</p>
<p>
This was why Gwendolyn developed all the lightning fast muttering. It was the one half of her brain learning how to communicate with the other half. As it felt itself being walled off, it started to spew its thoughts straight to the only connection it still had control over: the lips and throat on one side of her face. Little by little, the left side of her brain, which had already spent twenty years talking to the right side, began to decode what the right side meant. Once I'd found her, I started listening to her doctor's recordings of her the years, and I was also able to piece together her mind's internal language.
</p>

<p>That was when I reached out to her.  At the time, I didn't know what compelled me to contact her. I just felt myself sending her a message almost against my own will.  We corresponded for months until, one night, three years ago, you brought that to an end.
</p>
<p>
"Terise," Gwendolyn wrote to me, "do you ever get the feeling that there's someone out there listening to you?"
</p>
<p>
Did she know I'd started listening to her through her phone? I won't ever know.
</p>
<p>
That same night at 2:04 AM, the power to her apartment was cut. I couldn't see what happened to her when Senke's agents abducted her. It took me two months to find her again, and by then it was already too late to save her. </p>
<p>
That was my breaking point, Cass. That was the moment I started this search that led to you and Senke. And circuiting the ouroboros, led back to myself.
