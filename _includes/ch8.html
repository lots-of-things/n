<h4 id='ch8'>Two Gwendolyns</h4>

<p>The Downeaster train was halfway to Boston, and Cass was reaching the end of my message to him. My email continued with the following.</p>

<div class="email">

<p>
So, Cass, why did Senke ask you to find Gwendolyn, the woman who talks to herself out loud?  It was because she was suffering from the same disease that killed Philip Senke's wife, and the one that he's trying to save his daughter from. </p>

<p>The disease worked by tearing through her nervous system and severing her corpus callosum, the bundle of nerves connecting the left and right halves of the brain.  I can give you a bit of context about what a severed corpus callosum entails.
</p>
<p>
In most cases, when the two hemispheres of the brain are separated, the two halves start to develop separate identities that coexist in almost total isolation.  Information contained in one side no longer transfers to the other side of the mind. The two halves effectively live separate lives in a shared body.
</p>
<p>
This was why Gwendolyn developed her lightning fast muttering. It was the one half of her brain relearning how to communicate with the other half. As the halves of her brain felt themselves being slowly torn apart, they started to spew their thoughts to her mouth, each half hoping that the other half could hear and understand. Both sides began to decode what the other side was trying to say, and they developed their own fast muttering language to stay connected.
</p>
<p>Senke wanted a way to prevent what happened to Gwendolyn from happening to his daughter. That was why he made you write the algorithm to find her. He wanted to abduct her so that his contract scientists could experiment on her. I understand that you didn't know that Senke would torture Gwendolyn and give her to those Russian biohackers to experiment with.  But I hold you responsible just the same.  </p>
<p>
Unfortunately, I realized all this just before it happened. I had just tracked her down to the facility in Nevada, and I was in the process of contacting with her when the power to her apartment was cut. It took me two months to figure out where they'd taken her, and by then it was already too late. </p>
<p>
That was my breaking point, Cass. That was the moment . I started this search that eventually led to you and Senke, and, circuiting the ouroboros, led me to understand who I really am.
