<h4 id='ch8'>Two Gwendolyns</h4>

<p>The Downeaster train was halfway to Boston, and Cass was reaching the end of my message to him. </p>

<div class="email">

<p>
So, Cass, why did Gwendolyn mutter her every thought out loud?  It was the result of the same disease that killed the Philip Senke's wife, and the one that he's trying to save his daughter from.  </p>

<p>The disease worked by tearing through her nervous system and severing her corpus callosum, the bundle of nerves connecting the left and right halves of the brain.  I can give you a bit of context about what a severed corpus callosum entails.
</p>
<p>
In most cases when the two hemispheres of the brain are separated, the two halves seem to allow their separate identities to coexist in almost total isolation.  Researchers have been able to show that information contained in one side isn't able to be transferred to the other side of the mind.
</p>
<p>
This was why Gwendolyn developed all the lightning fast muttering. It was the two halves of her brain learning how to communcate with one another out loud. As I listened to her recordings over the years, little by little, I was able to piece together her mind's internal language.
</p>

<p>That was when I reached out to her.  At the time, I didn't know what compelled me to contact her. I just felt myself sending her a message almost against my own will.  We corresponded for months until, one night, three years ago, you brought that to an end.
</p>
<p>
"Terise," Gwendolyn wrote to me, "do you ever get the feeling that there's someone out there listening to you?"
</p>
<p>
Did she know I was listening to her? I won't ever know.
</p>
<p>
That same night at 2:04 AM, the power to her apartment was cut. I couldn't see what happened to her that night when Senke's agents obducted her. It took me two months to find her again, and by then it was already too late to save her. </p>
<p>
That was my breaking point, Cass. That was the moment I started this search that led to you and Senke. And circuiting the ouroboros, led back to myself.
