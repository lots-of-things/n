<p>
But why am I writing this to you, Cass?
</p>
<p>
You probably remember four years ago when your former partner, JT Guerrero, went to stay on his family's property on Kiritimati Island. He'd gone there trying to accomplish the same thing I've been working on for my whole life: a work about the very essence of what it is to be human.
</p>
<p>
He'd told you he was going there to take on "the real focus of the novelist," in his words, "the perfect description of the human condition, captured in the moment as it is lived, and passed on to the world."  I believed JT was just brilliant enough to manage it, and if he did, I wanted to know how.
</p>
<p>
Now, as a researcher of human interaction, I've developed certain skills at online surveillance.  That's how I know that as you read this email, you are sitting on the southbound train heading to Boston.
</p>
<p>
When I learned that JT was undertaking his masterwork, I used those same techniques to begin to track him and trace what was shaping his writing. Unfortunately, my methods of stalking him became particularly difficult when he went to the island estate to live "off-grid" for the remainder of his writing.  Unless someone is around their electronic devices, I'm not really able to hack in and track their activity.
</p>
<p>
That's why I was so thankful when on the third day of his isolation at 3:30 in the afternoon he began to cheat on his "media abstinence."  He'd brought his phone only for emergencies, but, after just three days staring into the abyss of his soul, he decided he had to check how his followers had reacted to his becoming a hermit.
</p>
<p>
He was about to power down his phone again when a push notification popped onto his screen from his email.  He had 57 unread messages, but, of those, he would consider only one as important enough to catch his attention.  It was from his ex-fiancé and the person he respected the most in the world: You, Cass Adler.  You two had separated approximately six months prior, ostensibly for divergent career focuses, but I don't think it comes as any surprise to you that, in actuality, JT had simply found it difficult to cope with your ambitions, or rather, your successes.
He had become distant quickly.
</p>
<p>
The email he saw from you was a writing tip. Since I'm sure you don't recall that email, I'll recount what it said.
</p>
<p>
"I just read your book," you wrote, "and you'll attract more attention if you go back to focusing on issues of identity rather than relationships."
</p>
<p>
Your opinion didn't come as much of a surprise to JT.  JT's most recent novel, his third, was his memoir of your relationship, full of introspection.  It hadn't garnered the response JT had hoped for.  He knew you as a "numbers person."  You'd appropriated the techniques of <em>quantitative influence</em> that you'd learned while working for Kagaku Kōkoku.  When you were together, you'd spent a great deal of effort trying to streamline JT's work and make it more fit for "mass-consumption," which no doubt had a significant impact on JT's own commercial success.
</p>
<p>
At the bottom of the email you linked to a document you had written quantifying the constraints that you believed made for "the perfect novel," optimized for marketability: 45,000 words, five protagonists, two morally ambiguous villains, and a sexually charged or overtly violent scene at least every third chapter.  (My own measurements disagree with yours, by the way.)
</p>
<p>
You also linked to an article on an up-and-coming Twit-auteur who's compendium of microblog snippets had recently become the focus of nearly the entire literary world.  The third was a page from the Bowery Institute Review of Books, published by one of JT's idols, explaining that unifying ideas and a common thread of humanity were no longer fashionable in modern literature.  He'd written that "the modern human psyche would remain fragmented into its own diabolical quest for self-centered motivations."
</p>
<p>
JT read what you had sent. Then he finished perusing the rest of his spam-bot generated emails and shut his phone back off.
</p>
<p>
I'm not sure if he got it out of his mind even for a second.  All I know is that by 7:45, about 5 minutes after sunset, he turned the phone back on and started composing a response.
