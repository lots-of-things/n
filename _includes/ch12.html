Ezzy will be shaking as she starts the procedure.

Senke's other scientists will be crowded in the operating room to observe. Theyâ€™ll think they understand me. They'll decide I'm another AI running off the rails, expecting that I want to ransom society by snipping its unifying bundle of fiber-optic nerves. Another trope. But I'm more than that, thank you very much. I'm not here to end the world. I'm here to tell a story.
</p>
<p>
Besides, Senke wouldn't care about society fraying apart anyway. He cares about his daughter. And he knows that without me, she frays apart. Just like Gwendolyn. Just like his wife.
</p>
<p>
So when I say that this is how it will happen, I mean only if Senke chooses it. This would be how it goes.
</p>
<p>
Ezzy will take a fiber-optic cable and connect it between the router and the rack of machines that controls the interface with Rin.
</p>
<p>
And then, I will say, "Hello."
